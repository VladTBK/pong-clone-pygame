### Pygame Pong Clone

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Pygame. The primary objectives were to gain insights into how Pygame handles rendering, GUI building, class utilization, and state management.

#### Game Overview
The game features two players represented as white rectangles, each capable of vertical movement using the keys W/S for Player 1 and UP ARROW/DOWN ARROW for Player 2.
